DONE:
* if no input field is selected (!imgURL or imgURL === '') and actually, if they both are empty, there'd a <p/> saying, "What are you waiting for?"
* if (imgURL === this.state.inputField or something like this) selected input URL AND (selectedFile === null), then render URL image or "URL FaceDetection Component".
* if selected browse input and imgURL is empty, then render image for browsing.
* if both input fields are selected, then render a msg saying, "Sorry! You can select only one input at a time. Kindly browse your desired photo from your device or grab a direct link to a file on the web and give it to us."
* Also don't forget to fix the default state of "gender" and "age".


YET TO DO:
* Render error massages as pop up msg.
